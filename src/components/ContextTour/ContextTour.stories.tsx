            The Taj Mahal is an Islamic ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in the Indian
            city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1631 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (r. 1628â€“1658) to house the tomb
            of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the
            centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in
            formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.
